## Design System
KeepTruckin's own in-house Design System!

_A Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product._

## Getting Started
Since this is V1 of our Design System, we have made it very lightweight where we don't have a whole lot of bloat to get our app running.


### Setup
> A step-by-step guide for pulling our current Design System application through Github and serving it with a local php web server

```
$ mkdir workspace
$ cd workspace
$ git clone https://github.com/karstenrowe/kt-ds.git
$ cd kt-ds
```

> let's now serve our application
```
$ php -S localhost:8000
```

Your app should now be running and enter https://localhost:8000 on your browser of choice.
